# Unity Twitch Chat

This is a lightweight and efficient [Twitch.tv IRC](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) client for Unity.<br>The primary goal is to be able to read and send chat messages.

In short, this allows you to integrate Twitch Chat to your Unity projects.

### Supported features
- Reading and sending chat messages
- Parsing Twitch emotes and badges
- Optional anonymous login


### Unsupported features
- Special messages (whispers, sub/resub, raids, first time viewers, etc)
- Bits cheering, channel points, predictions, etc
- Moderation (ban, timeout, etc)
- Third party extensions (FFZ, BTTV, 7TV, etc)
- and more...

### Other limitations
- WebGL builds are not supported


## Installation

- Open Unity Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager)
- Click the `+` button in the top left corner
- Select `Add package from git URL...`
- Copy and paste the following URL:<br>```https://github.com/lexonegit/Unity-Twitch-Chat.git?path=/Unity-Twitch-Chat/Assets/Package#version=1.0.0```
- Install the package


## Quick start
1. Install the Unity package (see above)
2. Create a new empty GameObject and add the TwitchIRC component.
3. In the inspector, set your Twitch authentication details (OAuth, username, channel) 
You can generate an OAuth token at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
OAuth and username are not needed if `Use Anonymous Login` is enabled. 
4. Make sure `Connect On Start` is enabled and press play â€“ You should now see JOIN messages, etc. in the console.
5. To start handling chat messages, add a listener to the `IRC.OnMessageReceived` event. The listener will receive `Chatter` objects which contain information about the chat message, such as the chatter name, message, emotes, etc...
